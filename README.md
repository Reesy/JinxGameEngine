# JinxGameEngine
An OpenGL render engine using GLFW. 
This is a 3D game engine that I am developing as a base platform to create games. This repository will try to not include any application specific code and try to be quite open for use. This shall be messy -testbed- like code as I learn Game design and game engine programming. 

Uses: OpenGL3+, GLFW and glew for window and IO management. Uses SOIL for importing asset images. 
The Shader.h file aswell as the TextureLoader.h/cpp have been sourced from LearnOpenGL.com. 

Versioning system: 
    Major.Minor.BugFix

Currently the version is alpha, when it's ready for at least some minimal game creation the version will be 1.0.0+
