# JinxGameEngine
An OpenGL render engine using GLFW. 
This is a 3D game engine that I am developing as a base platform to create games. This repository will try to not include any application specific code and try to be quite open for use. This shall be a messy "testbed" for code as I learn Game design and game engine programming. 

Uses: OpenGL3+, GLFW and glew for window and IO management. Uses SOIL for importing asset images. 
The Shader.h file aswell as the TextureLoader.h/cpp have been sourced from LearnOpenGL.com. 

Versioning system: 
    Major.Minor.BugFix

Any respository changes such as editing the readme will not be included in the versioning system.

Currently the version is alpha, when it's ready for at least some minimal game creation the version will be 1.0.0+
